# Velobase Harness Documentation

**Language:** English | [Simplified Chinese](../zh-CN/README.md)

This directory is the English documentation entry for Velobase Harness. During the documentation migration, some deep reference pages still live in the legacy Chinese-first `docs/` tree. The stable public entry points below are the paths that README files and Velobase Cloud Launchpad prompts should use.

## Start Here

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Framework Guide](./framework-guide.md) | Architecture, local startup, code boundaries, module system, and production checklist |
| [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md) | How third-party integrations are organized and how AI should extend them |
| [AI Completion Checklist](./ai-completion-checklist.md) | Required self-check before commit, push, or deployment |
| [Web/API/Worker Split](./architecture/web-api-service-split.md) | Runtime split, `SERVICE_MODE`, Docker, Kubernetes, and deployment modes |
| [Documentation Style Guide](./docs-style-guide.md) | Bilingual docs structure, translation rules, and Launchpad prompt coupling |
| [AI Agent Rules](../../AGENTS.md) | Stable rules that AI agents must read before editing code |

## Documentation Rules

- Keep `README.md` as the English default and `README.zh-CN.md` as the Chinese root entry.
- Keep canonical long-form docs under `docs/en/**` and `docs/zh-CN/**`.
- Do not translate commands, environment variables, file paths, package names, API names, or code blocks.
- When a documentation path is used by Velobase Cloud Launchpad prompts, update the prompt generator in the Cloud repository in the same change.
